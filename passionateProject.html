     <h1>helping people</h1>
     

     <p>I’m passion about helping others making it feel like they have something to live for. I also wanna help make  the world a better place to raise your children and not be afraid for them to even leave the house. Its so much going on in different countries like water crisis and wild fires and a shorage of food and water so I would wanna just lend a helping hand. I be seeing so much going on within the world I live in and kids my age and younger going through so much and its not they fault. Some of the parents are not able to just up and move because of something thats happening where they live they have to just make the best of what they got around them. 
                     Then thats where I would come in and just try to put a smile on they face just to show them everything is not so bad. That its people out here who is willing to go the extra mile and who do wanna see them doing well its not gone hurt to show you care. Even if its not much just helping clean up after a hurricane or earthquake happen to show they don’t have to go through it alone. I know when I’m feeling down or something bad happen I just wanna know somebody care and wanna make sure I’m okay so I know they want it. I really learned about this through me going to school and watching cnn new because I don’t really like watching the normal news its just too much happening. But yeah thats really what im passionate about and my idea on how to help people and world not seem so bad and show people they not on they own through stuff like this.</p>
